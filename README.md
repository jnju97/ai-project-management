- **Issue & Risk Tracking:** For project teams, nTask includes simple issue tracking and risk management modules. You can log project risks or issues, assign owners, set severity, etc. It’s not as advanced as dedicated tools, but for small projects it helps ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Integrations:** nTask integrates with popular tools like Slack, Google Calendar, and Outlook to fit into your workflow. It also connects with Zapier for extended integration possibilities. You can get notifications in Slack or sync tasks to your calendar so you stay on top of deadlines.

**Who should consider nTask:** If you’re a **small team or startup on a tight budget**, nTask provides a surprisingly rich feature set for free (up to 5 team members with unlimited workspaces). Its design is approachable for non-project managers – you won’t get overwhelmed by options. While it might not have the depth for large complex projects, it’s more than enough for typical team task tracking, basic project planning, and keeping everyone aligned without any cost.

Wrike is an **AI-powered enterprise work management software** built to handle cross-functional projects and large teams. It provides 360° visibility into work, enabling seamless collaboration across departments while letting managers scale and optimize workflows.  

- **Customizable Workflows:** Wrike’s strength is in how you can configure it to fit complex processes. You can set up custom workflow statuses, project templates, and request forms that standardize how work is captured and executed. For instance, a marketing team can have a creative request form that, when submitted, auto-generates tasks in the design and content teams’ queues.
- **Dashboards & Reporting:** Every user can create personalized dashboards showing tasks by status, due date, priority, etc. Managers can roll-up multiple projects into overview charts and use Wrike’s reporting to spot bottlenecks or track KPIs. Wrike’s real-time reports are excellent for keeping stakeholders informed – you can even schedule them to be sent out automatically.
- **Automation (Wrike Integrate):** Wrike has built-in automation for routine tasks (like moving items or setting fields based on triggers), and an advanced integration engine called Wrike Integrate that connects to 400+ apps. You can design sophisticated workflows, e.g., when a deal is marked closed in CRM, create a project in Wrike automatically.
- **AI Work Intelligence™:** Wrike has invested in AI features, such as smart task prioritization, AI project risk prediction, and AI task summarization. Its AI sub-tool (occasionally referred to as **Wrike Work Intelligence**) can scan projects and flag if deadlines might slip or suggest who a task should be assigned to based on workload. It also allows you to use AI assistants to draft task descriptions or extract action items from meeting notes, speeding up administrative work.

**Best for:** Medium to large organizations that need **robust project portfolio management and cross-team coordination**. Wrike is known for its scalability – it can accommodate thousands of users and very complex project structures. It might be overkill for very small teams, but for enterprises, the granular control, security (it offers user permissions, role-based access, and even private instances), and advanced features like AI and integrations make Wrike a top-tier choice to let work flow efficiently at scale.
